 The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI's sophisticated analytics tools to examine sales performance across a number of product categories at Pick 'n Pay, the industry leader in electronics, home goods, and personal care products. By looking at important indicators, including as revenue, market potential, and sales patterns, and to show growth or decline, include graphic comparisons with prior years.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Pick 'n Pay Retail aims to enhance its understanding of sales performance across various products by analyzing key metrics, including total sales, profit margins, and order trends.The main challenge is to compare year-over-year performance, identify top-performing products and cities, and track customer preferences effectively.Effective decision-making about consumer behaviour, product performance, and geographical patterns is hampered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of these trends. Pick 'n Pay Retail can address underperforming cities, learn more about customer behaviour, product performance, regional trends, and direct future investments in important product categories by carefully examining these metrics. This will help the company make better, quicker business decisions across channels and regions.

# AIM OF THE PROJECT
- Give an overview of year-over-year sales performance, emphasising top-performing products and cities, and track customer preferences
- Analyze sales trends to identify high-performing and underperforming cities.
- Use Power BI to visualise sales KPIs and trends and give decision makers with actionable information
- Make suggestions for improving company profitability based on your insights

# MODELLING
The Pick ‘n Pay data model follows a star schema structure, with the Order Fact table (Order ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Channel, Order Quantity ,Order Date, Profit, Reginal ID, Currency Code), at the center, linking to key dimension tables (Customer-Dm, Product-Dm, Location-Dm, and Calendar-Dm) via primary keys. This design enables efficient filtering and analysis of sales data by customer, product, location, and time, providing powerful insights such as year-over-year trends, regional performance, and product-level profitability.
